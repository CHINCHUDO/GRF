    <h3>How <GRFTitle/> got started</h3>
    <p>
        <GRFTitle/> was started in 2019 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Since <GRFTitle/> is a party for redheads, we didn't want to charge for people to attend. This made growth truely organic and what we like to call a "ginger root" movement.
    </p>
    <h3>What is happening now</h3>
    <p>
        The global pandemic of 2020 has sidelined <GRFTitle/> events but we hope to continue them in 2021. We are still looking for volunteers to add to our planning board so feel free to contact us at GingerRedheadFestival@gmail.com or through our social media pages.

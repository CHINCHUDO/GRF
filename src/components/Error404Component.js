    <h3>Error Code 404. Something went wrong.</h3>
    <p>
        One of the following problems may have occured:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It could be that the link you followed has changed.</li>
        <li>You typed the link in wrong. That is ok. You can try again or use our site navigation.</li>
        <li>Perhaps the link is broken and we need to do something about it. Yikes! Contact us and let us know. We will get on it!</li>
        <li>Maybe that person who made fun of your red hair is once again plaguing your life, by working for the internet company for the sole purpose of rerouting you to a bogus link. The nerve!</li>
        <li>Or you are that person who made fun of someone's red hair because you are secretly extremely jealous, want to have red hair, and you are obsessed with ruining the lives of others you deem better than yourself. A bit like Voldemort marking Harry his equal because Voldemort had significant self-worth issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In any case, you may want to push the back button, choose from our menu options, or rethink your life and stop working for those abusive internet companies.</p>
